<p id="Babson">I chose Babson because of the community I experienced while visiting campus and the education it provided. I wanted to pursue both business and my passions in dance and photography, and Babson gave me this opportunity through the Babson Dance Ensemble and the Sorenson Arts Scholars. I also like the entreprenuership focus at Babson as I think it teaches many useful skills like self-motivation and problem solving. </p>
<p class="blue-border">My favorite sports to participate in are figure skating and dance. I grew up doing both of these sports and still continue them recreationally. I love the combination of artisry and athleticism in both. My favorite sports to watch, other than dance and figure skating, are soccer and basketball. My brother grew up playing both of these sports, and we now both follow the sports. While I was abroad in Copenhagen, I had the opportunity to go to two soccer games and loved them both!</p>
