<p>Full Life is a food and wellness blog that shares my experiences of ED recovery and how nourishment is leading me to a full life. It will feature recipes and real-life experience on the road to recovery, focusing on gaining back a full life, living life to the fullest. Topics blogged about will be focused on mental health, balanced eating, and my personal experiences. Recipes will be simple and varied as a balanced lifestyle means eating all types of foods – no “good” or “bad”!</p>
<p>The objective of this website is to share my experiences with my ED and connect with others who are struggling or want to learn more. In addition, the website will give people new recipes to try and food inspiration. It is important for people to learn about overall wellness and have a platform to connect with people who are interested in similar topics.</p>
<p>My target audience includes anyone interested in cooking and/or baking and those who are interested in health and wellness. It is specifically aimed at high school and college students aged 16-25 who are interested in holistic wellness and ED recovery. Not solely targeting people who struggle with eating disorders, but targeted at people who are interested in finding balance in their lives and eating more intuitively.</p>
