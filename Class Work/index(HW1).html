<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><img src="Images/IMG_1825.JPG" width="200" height="300"> I came to <a href="http://www.babson.edu">Babson College</a> because I loved the community. I was interested in business and the arts, and I was given the opportunity to pursue both through Babson's Dance Ensemble and Sorenson Arts Scholar program. I also wanted to move away from home and have a new experience on the East Coast. Babson was the perfect fit for this reason. After graduation, I plan to work in PR and events, hopefully one day working for a national or worldwide non-profit organization. I enjoy helping others and planning events, and these interests combine well into non-profit fundrasiing.</p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>My interests include yoga, running, photography, reading, and baking. Yoga has been something that I have done since middle school as a way to relax and destress. I currently run about three days per week and am volunteering as a running coach for middle school girls in Newton. Photography is something I like sa a hobby, but do not see myslef doing professionally. I enjoy taking portraits and candid photos of people, and I have even had the opportunity to phootgraph a few events. Reading is something I've loved since I was little and continue to do every day. I tend to wake up and read a good book while I eat breakfast! Baking is also somthing that I have done since I was little. My mom and I have found baking to be relaxing and a great way to spend time with each other. </p>
