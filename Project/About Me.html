                <p>Hi, I’m Anneliese, and welcome to Full Life Eats – a blog about my recovery from anorexia and the journey to health and wellness I went through to get where I am today. I’m an avid reader, yoga lover, and currently learning to love all the little things that make life great. As I've learned to appreciate food and the power it brings us, I love creating delicious, healthy recipes for a balanced lifestyle, and I want to share these with you. Recovery has taught me over the years that eating can be fun! There is no “good” or “bad” because food has no moral value. But all foods fit! Eat what you feel like and live a full life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> I am currently a senior in college and working with limited kitchen space, so recipes I create are simple and use only a few ingredients. Cooking with real ingredients make me feel good and nourished, so that’s what I focus on – living a healthy life mentally and physically keep me my best, and real ingredients give me the nourishment I need (and taste amazing!!). Anyways why settle for fake ingredients?? Fake friends don’t cut it, and neither does fake food. Check out my blogs for some real talk on recovery and life, and get cooking! Food is best when it’s made fresh and shared with those you love.</p>
