            <h2>Power of Positivity for Personal Wellness - 11/11/2018</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="letter">
                    It is too often taken for granted how much positivity and gratitude can do for happiness and wellness. And a big part of positivity and gratitude is self-care and self-love. I never prioritized self-love growing up. I overworked myself, I put others before me. I have always been a positive person and kind to those around me, but that kindness and gratitude towards others never seemed to translate to myself. The biggest lesson I have learned through my recovery journey is how to prioritize being grateful for what I have and who I am. I have learned to take care of myself through nourishment, a group of great friends, and being more aware of the good things in life. When I shifted my focus to prioritize the positive experiences, I started to become happier and recovery started to become easier. My ED over the years ignored my body’s need to be cared for and thanked, and instead told me that I was stronger than my hunger and that an image was more important than food and a full life. But now I focus on letting my pile of good things grow. I challenge the negative thoughts into something positive – always knowing everything will be okay and eating will give me the nourishment I need to be strong and healthy.<br> 
                    <br>
                    Self-care is key to making sure that I stay positive and appreciate what I have. I keep a gratitude journal to remind myself of the positive each morning, and I always make time for cooking and baking to make sure I’m properly nourished. Self-care can also mean taking time to do things you enjoy – I love to read and do yoga, take walks, and talk with friends. Doing these things, even if just for 10 minutes, help me refocus my mind on what is important and put my health first. Whatever you enjoy, set aside some time each day to take a break and find a happy moment. I promise you it’s worth it. Positivity and self-care, focusing on the good helps lead to overall wellness.

    <h2>Grocery Staples and Fave Brands - 10/14/2018</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="letter">
Believe it or not, I love grocery shopping. Going through treatment I was surprised that so many people also struggling with an ED hated it. But my biggest issue with disordered eating was that I did not feel I was allowed to eat as much as everyone else out of fear of weight gain. I loved to cook and bake but wouldn’t eat any of it or eat only a couple bites because I thought that I needed to drastically restrict myself from eating all of the good food I was making. Now I’m using cooking and baking as a means to help me through recovery. If I can be creative in the kitchen, put in the work, and plate my food in a nice presentation, I am more excited to eat! So grocery shopping and finding the best and most delicious products is a way for me to make eating more fun and find balance and wellness.
