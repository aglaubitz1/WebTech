    <h2>Grocery Staples and Fave Brands</h2>
    <p>
Believe it or not, I love grocery shopping. Going through treatment I was surprised that so many people also struggling with an ED hated it. But my biggest issue with disordered eating was that I did not feel I was allowed to eat as much as everyone else out of fear of weight gain. I loved to cook and bake but wouldn’t eat any of it or eat only a couple bites because I thought that I needed to drastically restrict my portions. Now I’m using cooking and baking as a means to help me through recovery. If I can be creative in the kitchen, put in the work, and plate my food in a nice presentation, I am more excited to eat! So grocery shopping and finding the best and most delicious products is a way for me to make eating more fun. Below is a list of my staples and some of my favorite brands!<br>
