        <h2>Mac and "Cheese" 2 Ways</h2><br>
        <h3>Adding an allergy friendly twist to a childhood favorite!</h3><br>
        </div>
        <p class="letter">
            When I was younger I LOVED mac and cheese, and when I discovered my food intolerances, I was pretty upset that I would have to give it up for good. Luckily, I got creative and found so many ways to make non-dairy mac and “cheese” that even squeeze in some extra veggies without sacrificing the flavor! Try both and let me know what you think on my <a href="Contact Me.html">Contact Me</a> page!

        <h2>Oat my Goodness!</h2><br>
        <h3>4 Ways to Make Oats Fun</h3><br>
        </div>
        <p class="letter">
        Oatmeal has to be my all-time favorite food – the amount of combinations you can make with this food is amazing. And the best part is using toppings galore when it comes to oats. In general, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day – oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, yogurt, granola, muffins, you name it. I’m definitely more of a sweet person and so breakfast always leans more on the sweet than savory side - all about balance! To spread my oatmeal love check out these 4 favorite oatmeal recipe combinations, ready whip up in the morning in the microwave or on the stove! **I prefer stove cooked oats in milk instead of water for a creamier texture, but the microwave is much quicker and less clean-up!<br>
        For each add 1 part oats to 2 parts water or milk and cook on the stove or microwave for 1.5-3 minutes. Stir in ingredients before cooking and add toppings after. Feel free to get creative with toppings in any way you like! My favorites are nuts, seeds, dried fruit, chopped up protein bars, nut butter, granola, and maple syrup! Just add whatever makes you feel good in the morning!</p>

        If you’ve never tried Maca powder it smells and tastes similar to butterscotch. I love this superfood and the taste it adds to my oatmeal, especially with a splash of vanilla! Maca is a superfood said to balance out hormones, and while this is important, I eat it mostly for taste!<br>

        1 tablespoon maca powder<br>

        Chocolate all day every day! If I could incorporate chocolate into every meal I would. I love starting my day with a warm bowl of oats that tastes like a chocolate bar with nut butter melted in the middle.

        Recently I’ve fallen in love with carrot cake. And so when I figured out that oats could taste like carrot cake, I feel in love with those too.
