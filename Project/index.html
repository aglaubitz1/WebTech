                <p class="letter"> For people living with an eating disorder or not, the holidays can be tough to manage. They’re often focused around food and people are constantly talking about their own diets and commenting on how others eat. A birthday is no exception for this overwhelming feeling. My 22nd was the day after Thanksgiving making it double the holidays, but it was filled with smiles and laughter none the less. And 22 is the best when you shamelessly get to sing Taylor Swift and have a mini-dance party to celebrate feelin’ 22! Because reflection and identifying things I am grateful for have been positive and powerful for me over the years, I thought I would share 22 things I am grateful for this past year in honor of my birthday:</p><br>

                        This pasta is flavorful, simple, and filled with holiday colors! The sautéed spinach and tomatoes make this pasta pop with red and green, so it always reminds me of the holidays. This meal takes only as long as it takes to boil water and cook pasta – the perfect weekday balanced meal when you want something quick and easy. Simply cook pasta, sauté the veggies, and add some spice! Basil and lemon give this dish its fresh flavor while the pasta makes it the perfect healthy comfort dish.
