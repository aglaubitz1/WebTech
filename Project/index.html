                <span class="heading">Power of Positivity for Personal Wellness - 11/11/2018</span>
                <p class="letter">It is too often taken for granted how much positivity and gratitude can do for happiness and wellness. And a big part of positivity and gratitude is self-care and self-love. I never prioritized self-love growing up. I overworked myself, I put others before me. I have always been a positive person and kind to those around me, but that kindness and gratitude towards others never seemed to translate to myself. The biggest lesson I have learned through my recovery journey is how to prioritize being grateful for what I have and who I am. I have learned to take care of myself through nourishment, a group of great friends, and being more aware of the good things in life. When I shifted my focus to prioritize the positive experiences, I started to become happier and recovery started to become easier. My ED over the years ignored my body’s need to be cared for and thanked, and instead told me that I was stronger than my hunger and that an image was more important than food and a full life. But now I focus on letting my pile of good things grow. I challenge the negative thoughts into something positive – always knowing everything will be okay and eating will give me the nourishment I need to be strong and healthy.</p><br>

                        This pasta is flavorful, simple, and filled with holiday colors! The sautéed spinach and tomatoes make this pasta pop with red and green, so it always reminds me of the holidays. This meal takes only as long as it takes to boil water and cook pasta – the perfect weekday balanced meal when you want something quick and easy. Simply cook pasta, sauté the veggies, and add some spice! Basil and lemon give this dish its fresh flavor while the pasta makes it the perfect healthy comfort dish.
