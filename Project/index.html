                Grocery Staples and Fave Brands
                <p>Believe it or not, I love grocery shopping. Going through treatment I was surprised that so many people also struggling with an ED hated it. But my biggest issue with disordered eating was that I did not feel I was allowed to eat as much as everyone else out of fear of weight gain. I loved to cook and bake but wouldn’t eat any of it or eat only a couple bites because I thought that I needed to drastically restrict my portions. Now I’m using cooking and baking as a means to help me through recovery. If I can be creative in the kitchen, put in the work, and plate my food in a nice presentation, I am more excited to eat! So grocery shopping and finding the best and most delicious products is a way for me to make eating more fun. Below is a list of my staples and some of my favorite brands!</p><br>

                Oat My Goodness!
                <p>Oatmeal has to be my all-time favorite food – the amount of combinations you can make with this food is amazing. And you better believe I use toppings galore when it comes to oats. In general, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day – oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, yogurt, granola, muffins, you name it. I’m definitely more of a sweet person and so breakfast always leans more on the sweet than savory side. To spread my oatmeal love check out these 4 favorite oatmeal combinations, ready whip up in the morning in the microwave or on the stove! **I prefer stove cooked oats in milk instead of water for a creamier texture, but the microwave is much quicker and less clean-up!<br>
                    For each add 1 part oats to 2 parts water or milk and cook on the stove or microwave for 1.5-3 minutes. Stir in ingredients before cooking and add toppings after. Feel free to get creative with toppings in any way you like! My favorites are nuts, seeds, dried fruit, chopped up protein bars, nut butter, granola, and maple syrup!</p>
