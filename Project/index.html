                <p class="letter"> For people living with an eating disorder or not, the holidays can be tough to manage. They’re often focused around food and people are constantly talking about their own diets and commenting on how others eat. A birthday is no exception for this overwhelming feeling. My 22nd was the day after Thanksgiving making it double the holidays, but it was filled with smiles and laughter none the less. And 22 is the best when you shamelessly get to sing Taylor Swift and have a mini-dance party to celebrate feelin’ 22! Because reflection and identifying things I am grateful for have been positive and powerful for me over the years, I thought I would share 22 things I am grateful for this past year in honor of my birthday:</p><br>

                        When I was younger I LOVED mac and cheese, and when I discovered my food intolerances, I was pretty upset that I would have to give it up for good. Luckily, I got creative and found so many ways to make non-dairy mac and “cheese” that even squeeze in some extra veggies without sacrificing the flavor! Try both and let me know what you think on my <a href="Contact Me.html">Contact Me</a> page!
